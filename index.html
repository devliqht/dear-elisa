        <h1>Dear Elisa,</h1>
        <p>Hi.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        <p>I know that doesn't mean much right now, especially with after everything I’ve done. I know you'll never see me the same, and I get it. </p>
        <p>It's okay to not know what to do now, because I also do not know what to do.</p>
        <p>I have my shortcomings as a person, I am a red flag. But I know that, that doesn't also make up for the things I've done. For the lies and for the trust I've broken. It shouldn't be as simple as "just accept me for who I am." I also need to change, not just for myself but for the people I love—including you.</p>
        <p>I understand that you doubt my words and that you are wondering what else am I hiding, lying from you. I'll come clean.</p>
        
        <h2 style="padding-bottom: 0">I've said the n-word.</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0">To my current bosconians friendgroup, and especially to khen. In real life, and in chat. No one else. </p>
        <p>I've never said it to cassie, to my college friends, or to my SHS friends like my group with nila Pam, with sam, with nila Faye and Raf. </p>

        <p>I get mad at you and I get upset at you.</p>
        <p>I lied that I didn't lie to you.</p>

        <div style="padding: 1rem"></div>
        <h2>With that, there's also truths that I've said:</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0">I've only told khen and cassie about our freakys. <b>No one else.</b></p>
        <p>I've never told anything to my bosconian friends, to my college friends, or to my and our SHS friends. Although, I acknowledge that some of them may have a hint because of the freaky reels I previously liked, now deleted. I don't know to what extent how many of them have a hint.</p>

        <p>I never lied when I said I'm not here only for the freaky. I don't want freaky only.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0" >I've never lied when I said I want to be with you forever.</p>
        <p>I've never lied when I said I'm trying to be the best for you.</p>

        <p>I've never lied when I said I hated cheaters. I will never break the promise of not becoming a cheater, because I've never tolerated cheaters ever since.</p>
        <p>I never lied anything about my past ex, my past flings. I never want to be with them again. I never lied when I said that I choose only you.</p>
        <p>I never lied when I said I am forgetful.</p>
        <p>I was always genuine when I said I didn't wanna lose you. That I cry everytime of the thought of losing you.</p>
        <p>I've always loved you. So much. Ever since the day of the confession. I've loved you as a friend and as a partner.</p>
        <p>And I always find you pretty, regardless of what you think about yourself. Because you are.</p>
        <p>But with the truths and lies, I know you have one question in mind.</p>
        <div style="padding: 1rem"></div>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        
        <p>The honest answer is, I was ashamed.</p>
        <p>I was afraid to lose you. I wanted to hide my imperfections from you. I wanted to be perfect for you, to be the kind of partner you deserved. I didn’t want to be the partner that your family would not like, the partner that you wouldn’t like. And, instead of achieving that, I instead hurt you and betrayed the trust you gave me.
        </p>
        <p>So I hid. So I lied.</p>
        <p>I lie to my friends and I lie to my parents.</p>
        <p>But most importantly, I lied to you. And in doing so, I hurt you deeply.</p>
        <p>All because I wanted to protect you from me. I see now that this wasn’t protection—it was selfishness. I failed to consider you during those times that I acted irrationally. I failed to consider you when I realized I was starting to say the n-word. And I lied multiple times out of defensiveness.</p>
        <p>I failed to consider you when khen and cass asked me if we did it.</p>
        <p>So I told them, out of acting irrationally. Because they repeatedly asked me. But I know it could've been prevented if I wasn't just, loud. If I just closed my mouth and respected you and remained private. That, I failed to do. I failed to set boundaries.</p>
        <p>I made a lot of promises. I've broken some, including this. I understand that all other promises may feel like they don't hold anymore.</p>

        <p>I understand that my actions hurt you. That I've broken your trust. That I failed to consider and respect you. I know it's irreversable damage, I know that you won't see me the same as anymore. You trusted me, and I let you down, not just by lying, but by failing to consider your feelings and respect you in the moments that mattered most.</p>
        <p>I'm not asking you to stay with me, I respect your decision. I know we promised to be forever. I really do want us to be together forever. I still love you so much, but I know it also hurts to love. I can only imagine how difficult it is to doubt me, someone you trusted so deeply.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        <div style="padding: 1rem"></div>
        <p>If there's one thing that I know I'll never fail to do, is to owe up to my mistakes. I'll always take responsibility. I know I'm not a perfect person. Not a perfect partner. But I tried to hide that, because I'm ashamed. I swear that, whatever the outcome of this situation, I'll learn from it to become a better person. For you, and also for my self. I will work on setting better boundaries, to not be easily influenced, and being transparent to everyone, to avoid lying. I will forever <b>stop</b> saying the n-word.</p>

        <p>And if you ever change your mind, I'll be here, waiting. Because risking to love someone else isn't something I'm willing to do anymore. If there’s one regret I will always carry, it’s not treating you properly when I had the chance. You will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
        <p>You deserve someone who respects and values you fully, and I know my actions have failed to show that. If your decision is to move on, I will support you and hope for your happiness above all else. I wish to see you happy and succeed in life.</p>
        <p>I love you.</p>
        <p>And if life brings us together again, I’ll be grateful for the chance to love you better.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
